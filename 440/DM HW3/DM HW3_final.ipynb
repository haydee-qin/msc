    "Description: Market Basket Analysis (Chapter 6) is commonly used in \"recommender\" systems. The basic idea is to discover interesting rules of the form {If someone likes these} -> {then they may also like these}. Download and get to know the Anonymous Microsoft Web Data Data Set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anonymous+Microsoft+Web+Data\n",

    "All students must perform MBA using the Apriori algorithm. Students enrolled in 440 (Grad students) must in addition also perform analysis using the FP_GROW algorithm and compare the results of the two algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use \"library\" functions. The Kagle tutorial is a good resource, but you must apply this to the dataset at hand (https://www.kaggle.com/code/rockystats/apriori-algorithm-or-market-basket-analysis). Submit a pdf \"paper\"/\"report\" describing the problem, your approach to pre-processing, the tools you used, the problems you encountered and your results. Briefly discuss why your results are \"interesting\" and not \"trivial\". Discuss your choice of min_support and confidence. (The target size of the paper is 5 pages, but your mileage may vary.) Only include essential code in the body your paper. Include the full code and sample runs you used as an appendix to the paper.\n",

    "Proper formatting of the paper is essential and counts for the grade. Get familiar with standard ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) standards. Please understand : results are of course important, but proper presentation is also important. For extra credit (30%) implement the algorithms yourself without libraries."

    "\n",
    "This is an implementation of the FP-growth algorithm in Python. The FP-growth algorithm is used for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. The implementation is based on a tree-based data structure called an FP-tree. The goal of the algorithm is to find frequent item sets (sets of items that occur together frequently in a dataset) from a transaction database, where a transaction is a set of items. The algorithm first builds an FP-tree from the transaction database and then generates frequent itemsets from the FP-tree by using a pattern growth approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code defines two classes, Node and Fp_growth. The Node class is used to define the structure of each node in the FP-tree, with each node having a name, a count (the number of times the item represented by the node appears in the transaction database), a nodeLink (a link to the next node with the same item name), a parent node, and a dictionary of children nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fp_growth class implements the FP-growth algorithm, with the main function being create_fptree. This function takes as input a dictionary of transactions, the minimum support (the minimum number of times an item must appear in the transaction database to be considered frequent), and a flag that indicates whether the output should be in the form of rules or not. The function first builds the header table and the frequent item set. It then builds the FP-tree by updating the tree based on the transactions in the database. Finally, it generates frequent item sets by using a recursive approach to find frequent patterns in the tree."

    "Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to discover the underlying relationships and patterns among the items in a large dataset. The Apriori algorithm operates by using a \"bottom up\" approach, starting with individual items and then combining them to form larger itemsets. The algorithm uses two main parameters, support and confidence, to determine which itemsets are considered frequent and which association rules are considered strong. The support of an itemset is defined as the proportion of transactions that contain the itemset, while the confidence of an association rule is defined as the proportion of transactions that contain the antecedent of the rule that also contain the consequent. The Apriori algorithm is widely used in market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and many other data mining tasks."

    "Apriori algorithm is an association rule learning algorithm used to find frequent item sets in large datasets and generate association rules from those item sets. It works by identifying combinations of items in a dataset that occur frequently together, using the concept of \"support\". The support of an item set is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain the item set. The algorithm starts by finding all the items that have a support greater than a specified threshold, called the minimum support. These items are then combined to form larger item sets, and the process is repeated until no further frequent item sets can be found. Association rules can then be generated by computing the \"confidence\" of the rules, which is defined as the proportion of transactions containing the antecedent (left-hand side) of the rule that also contain the consequent (right-hand side). The Apriori algorithm is commonly used in market basket analysis and recommendation systems, among other applications."
